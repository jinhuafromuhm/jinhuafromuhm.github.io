For me design pattern is a difficult topic to understand. Design pattern is an idea of having different templates or models for different goal of coding. The idea of design pattern came from the book also named as **Design Patterns** that inspired by Christopher Alexander's **A Pattern Language**. A brief intro about **Design Patterns** is that the book is also known as "Gang of Four" book, and there are 23 different patterns of C language that the books mention and each pattern has its advantage and disadvantage. In other word, design pattern is a guide of how people would design their code: write down the idea of how and what task would the code perform. Design pattern is not for C language only, the idea of it can also apply to any other programming.
