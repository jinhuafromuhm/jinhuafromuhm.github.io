This week I had a great experience of using intelliJ. Eslint with IntelliJ is very convenience for programmers fixing the problem of their code. When a problem occurs, a red line appars and shows what is the mistake I make and the options of how to fix it. A easy way is to click the bulb and fix the problem by the automatically. Sometime a red line occur is not because of making mistake of the code, it is the format of the code that is not formal. For instance, if a there is no space after a comma, the red line will warn me that I have to give a space after a comma. 





IntelliJ is a good tool to practice writing code. Each time I make mistake the machine tells us ,"hey you should do this to write your code formally." The more the machine reminds me, I would remember that "I shouldn't do this because red line will occur. " To avoid the red line and achieve the green check mark. I can learn from mistake and stop writing with bad habit. Coding standard, for me is like a list of rules that I have to follow. If I fully obey the rules, I will get green check mark. 



However, making mistake is a step of learning, coding standard tells you what mistake I make. Understand the mistake and see how to do it correctly, this help me learning coding better. Expecially for me, a javaScript beginner, coding standard is an pair of eyes read through the code I wrote and found out the problem I had, I must say it is very hard for me to read through my own code and find out the mistake. Coding standard really helps me out with finding problems.
