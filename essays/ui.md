What I learned from last week was making a website using HTML and css. However it does not look like any website that we look at online, those websites have better framework that attract people's attention. Semantic UI can make websites look better. Using Semantic UI to align all the content you want to put on the webiste, use different designed to show the elements of the website, let the readers enjoy looking at the website. That is what I think Semantic UI is. 



Using Semantic UI to arrange the content for html and css does need to spend extra time and even face different problems of formating. But thinking of getting more view from people and showing interesting websites to them, isn't this a good motivation for programmers to work hard on Semantic UI? Semantic UI can make a raw html and css website to have a better appearance, to have a professonal website. A website that has good content, and also good design, isn't it catching people's eyeballs and asking them to stay longer on the website? And also it is convenience to add elements like dropdown, popup, make the websites alive and have no different with other websites people see, and realize that this is how the other website work. 






From this week of learning, I could really experience that how to make a good looking website, using elements of Semantic UI. Following the example from the Semantic UI guideline, and think which is a good choice of putting this piece of content on the screen. Just like having a solution of a problem, but try to convert the solution back to the given elements.
