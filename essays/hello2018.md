  A new semester comes along with the year of 2018. A new thing for me is I began to learn about JavaScript and in fact I am interested to it. I am a rookie of JavaScript, before this learning opportunity I only have heard about it but not seen or used. Compare to Java, JavaScript is easier for me because from my first week of practice I didn’t have to create a class or start with public static void main (string [] args), and put the burly bracket if I don’t start a function. I realize that most of the arithmetic is like Java, the basic code is easy to understand and use; but I still need to practice more about the array section because I am not getting used to it yet. 
	
  
  
  
  Speaking of the WOD practice, it is also my first time trying a new way of learning. Time is pressuring me to finish a task. WOD is a real-life situation of finishing the task in time or you are going to fail. But for the first WOD I was stressed about it because the WOD is easy for me and I had started think about how to do it while I was reading the instruction. If I can’t understand the instruction or come up a solution of the problem I would be very stressful and unable to finish the real WOD. I should practice more and more times and be prepare for the WOD, to make me feel comfortable and less stress about the real WOD. And the WOD is also a real-life challenge, like an interview. If I can’t make it I don’t have a second chance to do it again, so I should be prepared and showing the best of me.   
	
  
  
  
  
  2018 is a great year because I started to travel to the world of JavaScript and I hope I can get better on it. And the WOD is a great opportunity to be push myself to finish tasks in time.
