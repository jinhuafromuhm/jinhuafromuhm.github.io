I choose to study Computer Science because I enjoy the moment when I completed an assignment, this feel like one of the game achievement has been accomplished, and the game is real life. People would think that completed an assignment is not a big deal, but for me that a completed assignment can cheer me up. 


Learning computer science is more difficulty for me. English is my second language, and I take more time to think about the meaning of the sentences. If learning a program language would like this:

function learningProgramming(programingLanguage);

Then the function for me would be:

function Translate(EnglishToChinese);
translate(learningProgramming(programingLanguage));

I have to run one more function than other people do.

The career of computer science is competetive. There are many people who were skillful and know many different languages. It is hard to compete with them. But for me, I don't have to be knowing all kinds of computer languages, all I need is that to be improving the skills on the languages that I interested to. Right right the programing lanugae I learn the most is Java and I currently learning javascrpits which I also found interested. I should foucs and be specialised on these languages, improve myself as the best I can.
