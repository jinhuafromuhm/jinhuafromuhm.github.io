summary: An assignment from ICS 331 that having a pixel pong bouncing on the display screen by using MIPS Simulator.
---

ICS 331 had introduced a software called MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator, also known as MARS. The assignment about the bouncing pong was using MARS. To complete this assigment I had to draw a 4x4 pixel pong with the file that provided a function call set column from the instructor. And then adding new function that worked with the set column function in order to make the -ball move.   

In this assignment I was discussing with classmates and TA, and figured out how to draw a 4x4 pong and let it bounce in the display screen. 

Here is how to pong look like in MARS :https://jinhzheng.github.io/pong.mp4
