summary: An assignment from ICS 331 that having a pixel pong bouncing on the display screen by using MIPS Simulator.
---

ICS 331 had introduced a software called MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator, also known as MARS. The assignment about the bouncing pong was using MARS. To complete this assigment I had to draw a 4x4 pixel pong with the file that provided a function call set column from the instructor. And then adding new function that worked with the set column function in order to make the -ball move.   



In this assignment I was discussing and working with classmates and TA, the process of this assignment is figured out how to draw a 4x4 pong in 4 columns. And then erased the pong before the pong moves. Next, gave the pong a pattern to move forward and upward, like a fraction slope for a graph. And the last step was to set the condition that the pong hit anyside of the wall the pong would bounce backward.  

Parts of the function that draws and erase the ball would look like this:
