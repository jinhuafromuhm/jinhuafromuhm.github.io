There was a project that I did for a Chinese class in 2016, which was to be a tutor in Chinese 101 class. The work I needed to do was Chinese dialogues practice and homework correcting. Chinese is my first language, it is not hard to say the words correctly, but it is a chanllenge to teach non-chinese speaker to pronouce. I had to think about how to interpret the words in English, English and Chinese have different pronounciation: syllable and tone. And sometime sentences can't interpret directly because there are words that can't explain in English. 




Learning a second language is same as learning a computer language. Understand the elements of the languages, like words and grammar, in computer language, constructor and name of the function. To express the words in different languages, people should follow the rules of the language, then the "expression" can make sense and understand.
